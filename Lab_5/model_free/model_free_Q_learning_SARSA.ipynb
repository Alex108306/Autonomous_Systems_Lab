    "## Gynmasium environments\n",
    "[Farama Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) is a collection of environments designed for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It is a Python library that offers easy-to-use interfaces for a wide range of environments, originally provided by OpenAI. The environments are organized into categories such as classic control, Box2D, toy text, algorithmic, MuJoCo, robotics, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each environment is implemented as a Python class that provides consistent methods to interact with them. These methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reset()`: Resets the environment to its initial state and returns the initial `observation`.\n",
    "- `step(action)`: Executes the provided action, returning the next `observation`, the `reward`, two termination booleans (`truncated` or `terminated`), and an additional `info` dictionary.\n",
    "- `render()`: Renders the environment for visualization purposes.\n",
    "- `close()`: Closes the environment and frees resources.\n",
    "- `seed(seed_value)`: Sets the seed for the environment to ensure reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This standardized interface makes it simple to develop, test, and compare RL algorithms across different environments.\n",

    "The FrozenLake-v1 environment is a 4x4 grid world where the agent has to reach the goal without falling into a hole. The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The environment is stochastic, meaning that the agent can slip and move in a different direction than the one it chose. The environment is considered solved when the agent reaches the goal state. The agent receives a reward of 1 when it reaches the goal and 0 otherwise.\n",
