# Robot Learning Labs

This package contains a collection of labs to understand the principles of reinforcement learning and supervised learning. 

## Available Labs
- **Lab 1: Dynamic Programming**  
    Introduces the concepts of dynamic programming in reinforcement learning, including policy evaluation and improvement.
- **Lab 2: Model-free learning**  
    Focuses on model-free reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and SARSA.
- **Lab 3: Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**  
  Explores the implementation of Deep Q-Networks as well as its main improvements.
- **Lab 4: Policy Gradient Methods**  
  Covers policy gradient methods including REINFORCE and Actor-Critic algorithms.
- **Lab 5: Behaviour Cloning**(_To be added_)  
  Introduces the concepts of supervised learning for cloning policies.
